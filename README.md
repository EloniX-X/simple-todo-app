# simple-todo-app
simple todo app made with flask and sqlite

i made this from scratch with no tutorials or complete compying. i wrote all the code myself.

WHY I MADE THIS:
This is one of the bigger projects that I really wanted to do from the start. I plan on making a couple tools for my own schoolwork like a flashcard and maybe even a kahoot copy. 

WHAT I LEARNED:
I learned a lot about flask and html css as well as flask mainly. I also used a lot of the sqlite skills I learned from previous projects. One of the bigger things i learned was how to coexist with chatgpt, this was kind of scary for me to actually be using it since I don't want to become completely reliant so i just used it to answer questions. But it was really scary seeing how much better than me it was.
